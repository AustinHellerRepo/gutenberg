# Author Similarity Detection

This project aims to use natural language processing techniques to compute the
similarity between known authors and new pieces of prose.  The Project Gutenberg
corpus is used to compute fingerprints of various famous authors.  The
fingerprints are then used to find which authors are the most similar to any
given text.
